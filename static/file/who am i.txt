Who i am ?
When i was 18 years-old, i am interested in this question.i like reading books or article about psychology.at the same time i subscribed a account that foucs on psychology field . it publish content almost everyday.i still remeber the time that i 
am addicted to pychothrepy etc. 在大一的暑假，i learned some branches of psy subject like abnormal psy and emtion psy etc.Although i read these books ,my life didn't change.oh,
shit! Maybe reading is the worst way when you want to master something.so i give up learning content about psychology. time goes so fast.Now i am a junior student, sometimes i can't help recalling the past.as if .... i don't know why i can't help doing that.especially i listen to some music that are play frequently at past. it's weird.ok ,all right , i want to get the answer . first(i always use the word in my english writting),i am not very confident,i often feel inferior when i see someone who has good-looking face or has a special skill.Second i am finding some goals or faith that can drive me doing something.i still feel confused about what the most important thing is to me.family ? i don't know . just now i asked myself i have to use some adjctive to descripe my self ? it's a tough question so that i have to run out my whole life.So who am i ?
